Introduction
This project is a demonstration of using FastAPI for building APIs, Kafka for messaging, and Docker for containerization. It aims to showcase my learning journey in integrating these technologies to build a simple yet effective application.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to create a basic application that leverages the power of FastAPI for handling HTTP requests, Kafka for message brokering, and Docker for containerization. This setup is particularly useful for building scalable and maintainable microservices.

Technologies Used
FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
Apache Kafka: A distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day.
Docker: A set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
Setup Instructions
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-kafka-docker.git
cd fastapi-kafka-docker
Build and Run Docker Containers
Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. Then, run:

sh
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Verify the setup
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the FastAPI documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

Usage
API Endpoints:
GET /items/: Fetch a list of items.
POST /items/: Create a new item.
Kafka Topics:
items-topic: Used for publishing and consuming item events.
